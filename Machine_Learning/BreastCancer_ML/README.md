# ML_BreastCancer

I am going to solve a Breast Cancer Classification problem using ML. The dataset I'm gonna use is public in this same platform: [dataset](https://github.com/selva86/datasets/blob/master/BreastCancer.csv)

The folder structure is as follows:
1. src/data_sample: full data and data sample.
2. src/notebooks: test notebooks.
3. src/results_notebook: final notebook with all the code.
4. src/models: the models that have been created and saved.
5. src/utils: The functions I create.
