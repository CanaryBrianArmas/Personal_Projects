# Personal Projects

On this repository I am gonna upload the projects I have worked on.

## Projects:

### [Translation Project](https://github.com/CanaryBrianArmas/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Deep_Learning/NLP/Helsinki_Opus_Books)

This project uses this dataset from HuggingFace: [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Helsinki-NLP/opus_books)

Thanks to [Person](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur) for adding this dataset on the platform.


### [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/CanaryBrianArmas/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Machine_Learning/BreastCancer_ML)

Detecting the cancer is something really important and we have to improve and discover new ways to detect it faster and in early stages. On this project I used ML to try to predict if someone is going to have breast cancer based on some features.
