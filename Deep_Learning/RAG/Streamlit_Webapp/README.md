# RAG System with Streamlit UI

A professional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a user-friendly Streamlit interface. This project leverages HuggingFace models to create a powerful document retrieval and question answering system.

## Features

- **Document Processing**: Upload and process documents to build a knowledge base
- **Semantic Search**: Retrieve relevant information using advanced embedding models
- **Question Answering**: Generate accurate answers based on retrieved documents
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for interacting with the RAG system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CanaryBrianArmas/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Deep_Learning
   cd rag-system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your HuggingFace API token:
   ```
   HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/main.py
   ```

2. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

3. Upload documents, ask questions, and explore the system's capabilities
